# Smart Contracts Documentation

## Overview

TradeGPT's smart contract system provides a secure, non-custodial infrastructure for AI-powered trading. The system consists of factory contracts, smart accounts, DEX integration, and test token implementations.

## Contract Architecture

```
SomniaTradeFactory

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Creates: SomniaTradeAccount (per user)
    ‚îÇ           ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Holds: ERC20 tokens
    ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Executes: Trades via DEX
    ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Controlled by: User's EOA
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Tracks: All created accounts by owner

SomniaDexRouter
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Interfaces with: MockDexRouter (testnet)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Executes: Token swaps

MockERC20 Tokens
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí USDC (6 decimals)

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

1. **Smart Account Ownership**
   - Each account has a single owner (EOA)
   - Only owner can execute transactions
   - Owner can be transferred, but this should be done carefully

2. **Agent Permissions**
   - Agents can propose trades but cannot execute
   - Agent address is optional
   - Agent can be changed by owner

3. **Factory Permissions**
   - No admin functions
   - Fully decentralized
   - No upgrade mechanism (deploy new factory if needed)

### Best Practices

1. **Always verify contract addresses before interacting**
2. **Use separate wallets for testnet and mainnet**
3. **Set reasonable token approval amounts**
4. **Monitor smart account activity**
5. **Keep private keys secure**
6. **Test thoroughly on testnet first**

### Audit Checklist

Before mainnet deployment:

- [ ] Conduct professional security audit
- [ ] Test all functions with edge cases
- [ ] Verify access control on all functions
- [ ] Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test with various token decimals
- [ ] Simulate failure scenarios
- [ ] Review all external calls
- [ ] Verify event emissions
- [ ] Test upgrade paths (if applicable)
- [ ] Document all assumptions

## Gas Usage

Approximate gas costs on Somnia testnet:

| Operation | Gas Used | STT Cost (estimate) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Create Account | ~350,000 | 0.0007 STT |
| Approve Token | ~45,000 | 0.00009 STT |
| Execute Swap | ~150,000 | 0.0003 STT |
| Recover Funds | ~50,000 | 0.0001 STT |
| Faucet Claim | ~45,000 | 0.00009 STT |

*Gas prices may vary based on network conditions*

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat test
```

### Test Coverage

Generate coverage report:

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

### Writing Tests

Example test structure:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

describe("SomniaTradeFactory", function () {
  it("Should create a new account", async function () {
    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const Factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SomniaTradeFactory");
    const factory = await Factory.deploy();

    await factory.createAccount(owner.address, ethers.ZeroAddress);

    const accounts = await factory.getAccountsByOwner(owner.address);
    expect(accounts.length).to.equal(1);
  });
});
```

---

## Contract Verification

### Verify on Block Explorer

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network somniaTestnet CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### With Constructor Arguments

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network somniaTestnet CONTRACT_ADDRESS "arg1" "arg2"
```

---

## Upgradeability

Current contracts are **not upgradeable** by design for security and simplicity.

### If Upgradeability Needed

Consider using OpenZeppelin's upgrade patterns:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";
```

### Migration Path

If contracts need updates:

1. Deploy new contracts
2. Update backend/frontend .env files
3. Migrate user accounts (if needed)
4. Deprecate old contracts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Execution reverted" errors**
- Check token balances
- Verify approvals
- Ensure correct function parameters
- Check access control

**2. Gas estimation failures**
- Set explicit gas limits
- Check for require() failures
- Verify contract addresses

**3. Account creation fails**
- Check if account already exists
- Ensure sufficient STT for gas
- Verify factory address

**4. Swap failures**
- Check token approvals
- Verify router has liquidity
- Ensure minimum output not too high
