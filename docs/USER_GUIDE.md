### Step 2: Create Your Smart Account

A smart account is your personal trading account that works with the AI assistant.

1. **After connecting**, you'll see a "Create Smart Account" screen
2. **Click "Create Smart Account"**
3. **Approve the transaction** in MetaMask
   - Cost: ~0.0007 STT (very cheap!)
4. **Wait for confirmation** (usually 5-10 seconds)
5. **Your smart account address** will be displayed

**What is a Smart Account?**
- A blockchain account specifically for AI-assisted trading
- You control it completely (non-custodial)
- The AI can propose trades, but only you can execute them
- Holds your trading funds separately from your main wallet

---

### Step 3: Get Test Tokens

You need test tokens to start trading.

1. **Navigate to "Faucet" tab** (sidebar)
2. **Option A: Get all tokens at once**
   - Click "Get All Tokens (One Click)"
   - Approve 4 transactions in MetaMask
   - Receive 1,000 of each token (USDC, WETH, WBTC, WSOL)

3. **Option B: Get tokens individually**
   - Click "Get" next to each token
   - Approve transaction in MetaMask
   - Receive 1,000 of that token

**Available Tokens:**
- **USDC** - Test USD Coin (used for collateral)
- **WETH** - Wrapped Ethereum
- **WBTC** - Wrapped Bitcoin
- **WSOL** - Wrapped Solana

**Note:** These are test tokens with no real value. You can request them as many times as needed!

### Step 4: Deposit Funds to Smart Account

Before trading, deposit tokens from your wallet to your smart account.

1. **Go to "Analytics" tab**
2. **Find "Fund Management" section**
3. **Under "Deposit Funds":**
   - Select token (e.g., USDC)
   - Enter amount (e.g., 500)
   - Click "Deposit"
   - Approve transaction in MetaMask
4. **Wait for confirmation**
5. **Check "Token Balances" table** to see updated balance

**Recommended Initial Deposits:**
- 500-1000 USDC (for collateral)
- 100-500 of other tokens (for trading)

---

### Step 5: Approve Router for Trading

This allows the trading router to execute swaps on your behalf.

1. **In "Fund Management" section**
2. **Find the warning box** about router approval
3. **Click "Approve Router for Trading"**
4. **Approve transaction** in MetaMask
5. **Wait for confirmation**

### Trade Interface

#### Left Panel: AI Chat

The chat interface lets you communicate with your AI trading assistant.

**What you can ask:**
- "What's the current BTC price?"
- "Should I buy ETH right now?"
- "I want to long BTC with 100 USDC"
- "Analyze the SOL market"
- "Give me a trading strategy for WETH"

**How it works:**
1. Type your question or request
2. AI analyzes market data
3. AI provides analysis and suggestions
4. If appropriate, AI creates a trade setup

**Chat Features:**
- Natural language understanding
- Market analysis
- Trade suggestions
- Educational explanations
- Markdown formatting support

#### Right Panel: Trade Composer

When AI suggests a trade, it appears here.

**Trade Parameters:**

**Asset** üéØ
- The cryptocurrency you're trading
- Examples: BTC, ETH, WBTC, SOL

**Side** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
- **LONG**: Bet price goes up
- **SHORT**: Bet price goes down

**Collateral** üí∞
- Amount of USDC you're risking
- This is your trading capital for this position

**Entry Price** üìç
- Current market price
- Price at which you enter the trade

**Leverage** ‚ö°
- Multiplier for your position (1x - 100x)
- Higher leverage = higher profit/loss potential
- **Recommended**: Start with 1x-3x for safety

**Stop Loss** üõë
- Price at which trade automatically closes if losing
- Protects you from excessive losses
- **Always set this!**

**Take Profit** üéØ
- Price at which trade automatically closes if winning
- Locks in profits
- Optional but recommended

**Example Trade:**
```
Asset: BTC
Side: LONG
Collateral: 100 USDC
Entry Price: $42,000
Leverage: 2x
Stop Loss: $40,000
Take Profit: $46,000
```

This means:
- You're betting BTC will go up
- Using 100 USDC with 2x leverage (200 USDC exposure)
- If BTC drops to $40,000, you exit (lose ~47 USDC)
- If BTC rises to $46,000, you exit (gain ~47 USDC)

### Using the AI Assistant Effectively

‚úÖ "Should I long or short ETH at current levels?"
‚úÖ "Give me a low-risk trade setup for WBTC"

```

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific about what you want

**Q: Is this real money?**
A: On testnet, no! These are test tokens with no real value. You can experiment freely.

**Q: Is my money safe?**
A: Yes! Your smart account is non-custodial - only you control it. AI can only propose trades, not execute them.
